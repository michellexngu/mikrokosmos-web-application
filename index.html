        <h2>Approach</h2>

        <p>
            I started by making a sketch of my application. Then with the use of the course material and the web I started creating a base mvc structure for the project. It was quite difficult at the beginning
            to generate everything the right way, in order for the IDE to recognize it as the right file. I had quite some difficulties with displaying the journal entries on a seperate page. Fortunately it did work
            in the end. I had a lot of fun exploring different approaches to present my projects. I am quite satisfied with how it turned out. I did the css styling as I went on. After getting the big chunk done, I got to
            start with the comment section for the user to interact with.
